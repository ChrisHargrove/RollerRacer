# Roller Racer

This project was to create a racing game using C++, SDL2 and OpenGL.

When the program starts it procedurally generates as many tracks for the player to race on that can fit inside a signed int.
The player can then choose which of these they wish to race on.

To handle all of the physics in this game I used the Bullet Physics Engine.
Due to inexperience with this API however it lead to the car being very unstable and has a tendency to roll over when travelling at high speeds. Hence the name Roller Racer.
